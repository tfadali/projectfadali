        <p>
        This is a little programming project I am working on, inspired by Project Euler.
        It seemed like a good fit for my current goals since it will allow me to
        show some of my full stack skill set while being simple enough to implement
        fairly quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
        I will be adding some interesting math problems in increasing difficulty.
        It remains to be seen whether I will get a domain name and release it to
        the public, but so far I only plan to come up with a few example problems.
